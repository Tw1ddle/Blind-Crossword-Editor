The highlight in the grid marks the position of the solution to clue number 29. This puzzle notes a 150th anniversary. Clues are presented in alphabetical order of their solutions. You will probably chew over them noisily. The primary source for solutions other than proper nouns is Chambers Standard Reference Dictionary. The secondary source is One Look Dictionary. On such occasions a tag will be employed. Alphabetical order is judged by the first word in a solution so that "a xylophone" comes before "an oboe".
